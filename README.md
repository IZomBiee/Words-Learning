# What is this program?

This is a program that can help you learn words in **any language**. It collects statistics every day and also collects statistics about each word. In addition you can add more languages.

# How to use?

1. Install python (I use python 1.12) [Here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Clone repository (Download all files).
3. Select the project directory

## By pip

1. `shell pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. `shell python "words_learning/main.py"`


## By Poetry

I wouldn't recommend it, I just wanted to try Poetry.
1. Install poetry 
    `pip install poetry`
2. Restart console
3. `shell poetry install`
4. `shell poetry run python "words_learning\main.py"`


P.S This is my first project on Github, I wanted to explore Git and Poetry. You can use whatever you need.
